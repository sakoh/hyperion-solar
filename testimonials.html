                <blockquote>“Burgess had excellent knowledge of the SunPower product. The communication of my project status was also excellent. All the people involved were great. Our project coordinator changed a couple times but even then, they were very good at communicating the next steps for us. The installation team was courteous, friendly, and professional. You could tell they really knew what they were doing. The whole experience of going solar was very smooth. I would recommend SunPower and Hyperion Solar to anybody that asks me.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>“I just wanted to say what a pleasure it has been working with you and the Sun Power team.  The same day I received your email back a crew should up and work diligently to find a repair the leak, which wasn't easy to locate.  They did not leave until they felt confident that they had explored every possible area!  As the LORD would have it, it rained hard these last couple of days and their work was tested and proven thorough . 
                </br>
                From the beginning  this project has been atypical, with plenty of curve balls and I want to commend you and your team for hitting each one of them out of the park. My wife and I could not be happier. You have made fans of us for sure and we are going to be referring all of our friends and family to SunPower!  If you ever need a statement on customer satisfaction for advertising please feel free to use any statements I have made here or we can write something specific for you guys.”</blockquote>
