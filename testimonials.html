							<blockquote>“Burgess had excellent knowledge of the SunPower product. The communication of my project status was also excellent.
								All the people involved were great. Our project coordinator changed a couple times but even then, they were very
								good at communicating the next steps for us. The installation team was courteous, friendly, and professional. You
								could tell they really knew what they were doing. The whole experience of going solar was very smooth. I would recommend
								SunPower and Hyperion Solar to anybody that asks me."</blockquote>

							<blockquote>“I just wanted to say what a pleasure it has been working with you and the Sun Power team. The same day I received
								your email back a crew should up and work diligently to find a repair the leak, which wasn't easy to locate. They
								did not leave until they felt confident that they had explored every possible area! As the LORD would have it, it
								rained hard these last couple of days and their work was tested and proven thorough .
						</p>
						From the beginning this project has been atypical, with plenty of curve balls and I want to commend you and your team for
						hitting each one of them out of the park. My wife and I could not be happier. You have made fans of us for sure and
						we are going to be referring all of our friends and family to SunPower! If you ever need a statement on customer satisfaction
						for advertising please feel free to use any statements I have made here or we can write something specific for you
						guys.”

								<p>"To Whom It May Concern:</p>
								<p>

									Any large investment is nerve-wracking. Whether you’re leasing or purchasing, the decision to Go Solar is one that no one
									should take lightly because it’s a multi-decade decision. A decision that takes into account technology, quality,
									construction, customer service, and trust that the company you’ve chosen will not only remain trustworthy, but that
									over the years, they’ll prove through intangibles that you’ve made the right decision.
									<p>

										Although it’s only been months since my wife and I signed the dotted line, we look back on our decision with a feeling of
										relief and comfort. From the first interaction with the sales representative, Codey McCarthy of Hyperion Solar
										Energy, to the SunPower solar panels, to the final stroke of the paint push against the stucco, I have felt that
										no matter what came up in the process, I was dealing with people who are honest and professionals through and through.
										All our questions before, during, and after the installation were quickly addressed by Codey. Then, as we neared
										the installation date, SunPower’s project manager was always clear, communicating clear milestones and what to
										expect. On installation day, the team that showed up were professionals, solid, knowledgeable, and customer-service
										oriented. Even when a misunderstanding came up, before I assumed the worst, the Director of Ops, Scott penneisen
										of Hyperion Solar, called me and assured me that they will take care of my concerns. And they did.
										<p>

											Since going live, I have peace of mind. That’s probably the best way to describe what I feel. When we have parties, I am
											not paranoid about the yard lights, or the air-conditioning running during the blistering heat storms. Also, I
											know my home is future-proofed against drastic price increases that will come to pass for my neighbors in the
											years to come. I am convinced that I’ve made the right decision for my home, my family, and my budget.
											<p>

												In the end, it is clear to me that large investments don&#39;t need to be stress-inducing if you’re working with companies
												who have the best technology, the best installers, and honest salespeople who want to do right by the customer.
												We believe that is exactly what we got when we decided to Go Solar with Hyperion and SunPower."
